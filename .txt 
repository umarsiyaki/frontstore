Banking on the previous example, here's how you can implement data validation:

_Form Validation_

Create a file called `validation.js` with the following content:
```
```
_Form Submission_

Update the `form.js` file to include validation:
```
```
In this example, the `validation.js` file contains a function `validateForm` that checks for required fields, email format, and returns an object with error messages. The `form.js` file uses this function to validate the form data before storing it in the database. If errors are found, it returns a 400 response with the error messages.Here is an example of how the file structure could be organized:

*Server-side files*

- `server.js`: Node.js server file that handles form submissions, logs activity, and serves pages
- `database.db`: SQLite database file that stores form data and activity logs
- `public/`: Directory containing client-side files
- `index.html`: Main page that displays product cards and forms
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the page
- `script.js`: JavaScript file that handles client-side logic and form submissions

*Database schema*

- `forms`: Table that stores form submissions
- `id` (primary key): Unique identifier for each form submission
- `name`: Name of the form submitted
- `data`: JSON data submitted with the form
- `timestamp`: Timestamp of when the form was submitted
- `activity`: Table that stores activity logs
- `id` (primary key): Unique identifier for each activity log
- `type`: Type of activity (e.g. form submission, page view)
- `data`: JSON data related to the activity
- `timestamp`: Timestamp of when the activity occurred

*Server-side code*

In `server.js`, you can use a framework like Express.js to handle form submissions and log activity. Here is an example of how the code could look:
```
```
This code sets up an Express.js server that listens for form submissions and activity logs, and stores them in the `database.db` file. It also serves the client-side files in the `public/` directory.


Here's an advanced example of data storage, posting, and form submission with database interaction using Node.js, Express.js, and SQLite:

*Database Schema*

Create a file called `schema.sql` with the following content:
```

```
*Database Connection*

Create a file called `db.js` with the following content:
```
```
*Form Submission*

Create a file called `form.js` with the following content:
```
```
```
This example uses Node.js, Express.js, and SQLite to store form data and activity logs in a database. The `form.js` file handles form submissions, validates data, and stores it in the database. The `server.js` file sets up the server and routes form submissions to the `form.js` file.

Note: This is just an example and you should consider security measures such as input validation, sanitization, and error handling in a real-world application.
